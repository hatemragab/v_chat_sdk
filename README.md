Vchat-sdk is a Saas (software as service) chat system that provides real-time messaging capabilities for your web or mobile applications. It
is divided into two parts: the server-side and the client-side. The server-side is built using Node.js and Socket.IO for
real-time communication, and MongoDB for storing all data.

One of the unique features of vchat-sdk is that it does not depend on Firebase for storing any data, but it provides the
option to enable push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging `FCM` or `OneSignal`.

Get started by **creating a new app or existing app in production**.

## About V_CHAT_SDK

- this package which written in pure dart and nestjs for serverside help you to add chat functionality
- unlimited text/image/video/record/location/push notification/control of data
- to any existing or new flutter mobile project with any **back-end** service you use
- **vchat-sdk** is a easy way to integrate advanced real time message chat with 6 public api only ðŸ‘Œ
- **vchat-sdk** use **Node js** as backend service and **Firebase** for (push notifications only) message database
  is **Mongo DB**
- for clint side is `flutter`

## About Micro Service

1. less load on your main server since chat has high traffic.
2. They enable scale. Scalability is about more than the ability to handle more volume. Itâ€™s also about the effort
   involved. Microservices make it easier to identify scaling bottlenecks and then resolve those bottlenecks at a
   per-microservice level.
3. They are relatively easy to build and maintain. Their single-purpose design means they can be built and maintained by
   smaller teams. Each team can be cross-functional while also specialise in a subset of the microservices in a
   solution.

## Use cases

1. If you want to have chat system in your app like whatsApp,facebook ...etc (perfect to social media apps)
2. If you have ecommerce apps and want to add chat feature to the app like delivery or OLX or facebook markets
3. Also, can be used for users real time chat support

## How V_CHAT_SDK works

- **vchat-sdk** connected with your backend service.
- vchat-sdk don't matter what is your backend code written because it will connect with it
  by public apis and run separately isolated but still connected by public apis
- When you register new user in your system you should call this public api
- so it will create separate database fro save users name,image,identifiers
- once the user connected successfully in your clint app usually this happens after success auth done
- you need to connect this user to v chat system, so he can contact with other users
- if you have already app run in production state, and you wish to integrate v chat you can do by migrate old users it
  will be explained in backend section

## technologies

1. For server side i use [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com) to build the code
2. [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) for save chats text and users data
3. [socket.io](https://socket.io) for real time communication
4. [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) or [onesignal](https://onesignal.com) for push notifications
   you can choose between them onesignal is perfect for countries that firebase is blocked ore you can enable all and v
   chat will manage to direct the user to the available platform!
5. Amazon (aws [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)) for secure and save users media i use pre signed URL to let the users
   access restrictions
6. [WebRtc](https://webrtc.org) for video and voice call but not stable 100% and need to
   paid [turn](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/turn-server) server so i will add supports for [agora.io](https://www.agora.io/en)
7. Clint side sdk only we support [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) with this public [repo](https://github.com/hatemragab/v_chat_sdk) for support all 

## Server Requirements for vchat-sdk

vchat-sdk is a lightweight Saas chat system that requires minimum server resources.

To run vchat-sdk, you need the following server specifications:

- 1 CPU core
- 1 GB RAM
- fast ssd storage
- any ubuntu version above 18
- we recommend to host in [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

In addition, you need to have a MongoDB database to store data. You can host a free MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas,
which is a cloud-based database service that provides a simple and secure way to manage your data.

With these minimum server requirements, you can easily set up vchat-sdk and start using it to enable real-time messaging
in your web or mobile applications.

With vchat-sdk, you can easily integrate real-time messaging into your applications without the need to build your own
chat system from scratch.

## Information's

1. this is not full app this only apis to make the chat development faster and easy! if you want full app then you need
   to look at **[superUp](https://github.com/hatemragab/superup)**
2. no prebuild admin panel ui but there are prebuild postman apis for integrate the chat panel to your system
   see [admin_apis](./backend/apis.md) section
3. all apis you can see it before you buy the source code
   see [PostmanCollection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24524392/2s93Jox6Dq)
4. need to see example of current `features`? then you need to see an open source clint app use v_chat_sdk here
   is **[superUp](https://github.com/hatemragab/superup)**
5. if you want to build a web version form this package you can use flutter web all packages support web for flutter
   but if you want to integrate with other projects like React or angular etc... you can do this by your self by
   integrating the apis and build your components using
   our [PostmanCollection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24524392/2s93Jox6Dq) collection `please read the docs
   there i have explained app apis params there` socket events explained [here](./backend/socket_io_apis.md)
   and [socket.io](./backend/socket_io_apis.md) events
6. this project purchasing from `codecanyou` has one time used **peer project** for multi project contactMe `hatemragapdev@gmail.com`
