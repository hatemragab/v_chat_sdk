# Introduction to vchat-sdk-V2
vchat-sdk is a Saas chat system that provides real-time messaging capabilities for your web or mobile applications. It is divided into two parts: the server-side and the client-side. The server-side is built using Node.js and Socket.IO for real-time communication, and MongoDB for storing all data.

One of the unique features of vchat-sdk is that it does not depend on Firebase for storing any data, but it provides the option to enable push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal.

Get started by **creating a new app or existing app in production**.

## About V_CHAT_SDK

- this package which written in pure dart and nestjs for serverside help you to add chat functionality
- unlimited text/image/video/record/location/push notification/control of data
- to any existing or new flutter mobile project with any **back-end** service you use
- **vchat-sdk** is a easy way to integrate advanced real time message chat with 6 public api only ðŸ‘Œ
- **vchat-sdk** use **Node js** as backend service and **Firebase** for (push notifications only) message database
  is **Mongo DB**

## About Micro Service

1. less load on your main server since chat has high traffic.
2. They enable scale. Scalability is about more than the ability to handle more volume. Itâ€™s also about the effort
   involved. Microservices make it easier to identify scaling bottlenecks and then resolve those bottlenecks at a
   per-microservice level.
3. They are relatively easy to build and maintain. Their single-purpose design means they can be built and maintained by
   smaller teams. Each team can be cross-functional while also specialise in a subset of the microservices in a
   solution.

## Use cases
1. If you want to have chat system in your app like whatsApp,facebook ...etc (perfect to social media apps)
2. If you have ecommerce apps and want to add chat feature to the app like delivery or OLX or facebook markets
3. Also, can be used for users real time chat support

## How V_CHAT_SDK works
- **vchat-sdk** connected with your backend service.
- vchat-sdk don't matter what is your backend code written because it will connect with it
  by public apis and run separately isolated but still connected by public apis
- When you register new user in your system you should call this public api
- so it will create separate database fro save users name,image,identifiers
- once the user connected successfully in your clint app usually this happen after success auth done
- you need to connect this user to v chat system so he can contact with other users
- if you have already app run in production state and you wish to integrate v chat you can do by migrate old users it will be explained in backend section
